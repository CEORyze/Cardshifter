Developer guidelines
--------------------

In order to ease development on this project, we ask you to follow the following guidelines:
 - If a ```.travis.yml``` file is present in your branch, then the Travis CI build system will attempt to build your branch and run tests on it and accordingly notify you of success or failure.
 - Please respect the coding standards of other people in their own submodules.
 - Open issues early and often, especially if you do not have time for the project for a few days, then other people can pick up the issue and attempt to implement it.
